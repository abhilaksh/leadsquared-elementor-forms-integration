A WordPress Plugin that integrates Elementor Pro Forms with Leadsquared.

Installation:
1) Download the plugin files and install it as usual.

2) Enter your keys in the settings page. 

3) Pull in your LeadSquared Database Schema.

4) Use the LeadSquared action in your Elementor Pro Forms to set up the connections. 

The field information right now is set up currently to accept:

a) Field id or Field Shortcode

b) Any other shortcode, 

c) Any dynamic tag,

d) 'FORM_NAME' (without quotes) to input the current form's name

e) Any string of text

Good luck!
